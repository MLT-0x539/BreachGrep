# BreachGrep
Tool for grepping my lists of historic data breaches that I have gathered over the years (breaches not included).

This allows you to easily search through and sort entries from historic database leaks. It is a better alternative to simply using a tool such as "grep" or "sift" -- although it is essentially doing the same thing as the likes of grep, it is doing so in a more efficient manner with far more capabilities.

Please note that the database breaches will **NOT** be included here, as I'd rather my github account didn't get suspended ;)
